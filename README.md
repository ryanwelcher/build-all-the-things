# Build all the things!

You need to change something in your WordPress projects build process. So let's just create a webpack.config.js and make the changes we need right?

**No. thanks!** Webpack is hard and you might not need to edit anything!

## Target files

It's possible to target files directly, just pass on or more files to `wp-scripts` and they will be compiled into a single file

### Single file

```json
"start": "wp-scripts start index.js"
```

### Multiple files

```json
"start": "wp-scripts start file-one.js file-two.js"
```

## Flags

The `@wordpress/scripts` package provides all kinds of options that provide ways to customize your build setup without having to create a custom configuration.

## Fast Refresh

In order to use `--hot` mode, you will need WordPress 6.6 or higher or the latest version of Gutenberg installed and have the `SCRIPT_DEBUG` constant set to `true` in the `wp-config.php` file of your development environment.

### Custom development urls

Under the hood, `wp-scripts` is using [`devServer`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) with the [`allowedHosts`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserverallowedhosts) option set to `auto`.

This ensures that if your local environment is using `localhost` as its URL everything will connect as expected.

If you're using a URL that is not `localhost`, you can get it working by customizing the configuration in webpack:

```js
const defaultConfig = require( '@wordpress/scripts/config/webpack.config' );

module.exports = {
	...defaultConfig,
	devServer: {
		...defaultConfig.devServer,
		allowedHosts: 'all', // This can also be set to a url i.e "dev-site.dev'
	},
};
```

## Multiple entry points

In order to have multiple entry points, you will need to create a custom `webpack.config.js` file in the root of your project.

This example will detect and build blocks as well as create discreet files for `slots` and `variations`.

`wp-scripts`exports its config, so it's possible to use it and only change the parts you need!

```js
// Import the original config from the @wordpress/scripts package.
const defaultConfig = require( '@wordpress/scripts/config/webpack.config' );

// Add any a new entry point by extending the webpack config.
module.exports = {
	...defaultConfig,
	entry: {
		// This will dynamically discover any blocks located in the `blocks` directory.
		...defaultConfig.entry(),
		// These are discreet entries that will be built separately.
		variations: './js/variations.js',
		slots: './js/slots.js',
		// Add more custom entries as needed i.e 'admin-screen': './js/admins.js',
	},
};
```

For more information on how to use `wp-scripts`, refer to the [official documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-scripts).
